🎯 The Core L0 Positioning

"Reasoning Without Compromise"

•  Persistent Edge Memory (the moat): Context across sessions, on your infrastructure, zero transmission
•  Zero-Latency Reasoning: 5-50ms vs. 500ms-2s for cloud
•  Complete Privacy: Nothing leaves your perimeter
•  Offline-First: Works anywhere, syncs when possible
•  Zero Per-Inference Costs: 5-50x cheaper than cloud at scale



💡 Why This Positioning Crushes

1. Unique Moat: Persistent memory is defensible (12-18 months for competitors to copy)
2. Enterprise Sweet Spot: Solves for ALL THREE constraints (latency + privacy + cost)
3. Compliance Native: HIPAA/GDPR/FedRAMP built-in (procurement advantage)
4. Economics Inversion: Bigger deployments = lower per-inference cost
5. Category Creation: Not competing, but defining a new category
