## KEY FEATURES SECTION

### Section Title
**Edge Reasoning, Enterprise Grade**

### Feature 1: Persistent Memory Service
**Title**: Persistent Edge Memory
**Description**: 
L0's core differentiator. Advanced semantic memory that lives on your infrastructure—not the cloud. Maintains context across sessions, learns from interactions, and grows smarter without transmitting data. Your knowledge stays yours.

**Key Points**:
- On-device semantic indexing and retrieval
- Session persistence without cloud sync
- Zero data transmission to external services
- Context window optimization for edge devices
- Real-time knowledge graph updates

### Feature 2: Zero-Latency Reasoning
**Title**: Millisecond Response Times
**Description**:
No waiting for cloud round-trips. L0 executes reasoning locally on edge hardware—mobile devices, on-premise servers, remote locations. Single-digit millisecond latencies for decision-making that demands speed.

**Key Points**:
- Local inference, no API calls
- Average 5-50ms response times depending on device
- Scales from smartphones to enterprise servers
- Degrades gracefully under resource constraints
- Built for real-time applications

### Feature 3: Offline Operation
**Title**: Works Anywhere, Anytime
**Description**:
Connectivity is optional. L0 reasons locally and syncs when available. Perfect for field operations, remote deployments, offline-first applications, and environments where internet access is unreliable or forbidden.

**Key Points**:
- Complete offline capability
- Automatic sync when connectivity returns
- Conflict resolution for distributed reasoning
- No data loss during disconnects
- Air-gapped deployment support

### Feature 4: Enterprise Security & Compliance
**Title**: Data Never Leaves Your Perimeter
**Description**:
Bank-level encryption, zero cloud transmission, and compliance-native architecture. Meet HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP, and data residency requirements by design—not through policy.

**Key Points**:

- Real-time knowledge updates

### Feature 8: Privacy-First Architecture
**Title**: Data Sovereignty by Design
**Description**:
Privacy isn't a feature—it's the foundation. L0 is built from first principles for environments where data never leaves the device or corporate perimeter. No data collection, no telemetry, no analytics.

**Key Points**:
- No cloud data transmission
- No external telemetry
- Privacy-by-default design
- Fully transparent execution
- User data ownership guaranteed

## HOW IT WORKS SECTION

### Section Title
**From Edge to Enterprise in Three Steps**

### Step 1: Deploy Locally
**Headline**: Deploy on Your Infrastructure
**Copy**: Install L0 on your edge devices, on-premise servers, or private clouds. No cloud dependencies. Complete control over where code executes and where data lives.

### Step 2: Build Your Memory
**Headline**: Populate Persistent Memory
**Copy**: Ingest organizational knowledge, documents, and data into L0's semantic memory layer. Your knowledge base is indexed locally, retrieved instantly, and never transmitted.

### Step 3: Deploy Agents
**Headline**: Launch Reasoning Workloads
**Copy**: Deploy customized agents that reason autonomously on your infrastructure. Build complex workflows, orchestrate multi-agent systems, and scale without cloud API costs.
