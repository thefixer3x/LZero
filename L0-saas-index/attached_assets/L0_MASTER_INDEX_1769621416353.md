Hammer it everywhere.\n\n### What It Does\n- Advanced semantic memory on your infrastructure\n- Maintains context across sessions indefinitely\n- Learns from interactions without cloud transmission\n- Supports full-text and semantic search\n- Never transmits data outside your perimeter\n\n### Why It's a Moat\n- High switching cost (data trapped in system)\n- Improves over time (network effects)\n- Competitors can't replicate easily (12-18 months)\n- Creates natural SaaS layers (managed memory tier)\n- Defensible business model (usage-based)\n\n### How to Sell It\n- \"Your knowledge stays with you\"\n- \"Context that persists and grows smarter\"\n- \"Instant semantic search across all your data\"\n- \"No transmission. No third-party agreements. No compliance nightmare.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Implementation Timeline\n\n### Week 1: Planning & Quick Wins\n- [ ] Review all documents\n- [ ] Start Phase 1 (content migration)\n- [ ] Update hero section\n- [ ] Update features section\n\n### Week 2-3: Core Implementation\n- [ ] Complete content replacement\n- [ ] Update code and metadata\n- [ ] Visual/brand updates\n- [ ] Test thoroughly\n\n### Week 4-6: Launch & Optimization\n- [ ] Deploy to production\n- [ ] Monitor metrics\n- [ ] Create supporting content\n- [ ] Begin enterprise outreach\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Pro Tips\n\n1. **Lead with Persistent Memory** - It's your differentiator\n2. **Use Real Numbers** - Latency benchmarks, cost comparisons, market size\n3. **Speak Enterprise Language** - Compliance, security, audit trails, SLAs\n4. **Position vs. Cloud** - Not against, but as a different category\n5. **Emphasize Trade-offs** - Honesty builds trust (\"we trade X for Y\")\n6. **Highlight Use Cases** - Make abstract concrete (\"HIPAA without BAA\")\n7. **Measure Lock-in** - Persistent memory size is your retention metric\n8. **Price for Deployment** - Not tokens.

It's the agent infrastructure for developers who can't afford latency, privacy violations, or surprise API bills.\"\n\n**60 seconds:**\n\"We've solved the false choice between cloud AI (fast but unsafe) and local models (safe but limited). L0 is edge reasoning infrastructure with persistent memory, zero latency, and zero per-inference costs. Your knowledge lives on your infrastructure, learns from your data, and never touches external servers. We're built for enterprises that can't compromise on latency, privacy, or cost.\"\n\n**2 minutes:**\nSee opening section of **L0_ENTERPRISE_POSITIONING.md**\n\n---\n\n## 🏁 Ready to Execute?\n\nYou have everything.
